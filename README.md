This is an assingment for the Code Fellows RoR Development Accelerator, the instructions for it were to: Create a method that accepts input n, and returns the nth fibonacci number. My method for this was pretty straight forward in following the fibonacci eqaution F_n = F_(n-1) + F_(n-2). I received assistance with this assingment and in understanding a recursive method from Kevin and Tony both students in the same Dev Accelerator.
